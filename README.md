# ðŸ¤– Autonomous Robot Project
Aim: Develop a robot that could navigate in a space where there are fruit and other random objects at random places. The robot will be given a list of fruit to search for. It needs to identify and locate its target, then move in front of its targets to "collect" them in order.
